# Queue-based Temperature Model

## Description
This is a repository for temperature research at ASU to examine different temperature and solar radiation patterns across different regions. Based on traffic flow theory and fluid approximation queuing theory, this model highlights a simplified version of the world's atmosphere and the relationships between solar radiation and total solar energy to draw several useful inferences about the system's performance, resilience, and adaptability.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git.
2. Navigate to the repository directory using cd REPO_NAME.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. Run the code in Queue-based_Temperature_Model.py

## Code Structure
The code is split up into folders: Data Collection, QueueBasedTemperatureModel, and spatial regression.
