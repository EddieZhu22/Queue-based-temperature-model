# Temperature And Solar Radiation Model Based On Polynomial Arrival Queue

## Description
This is a repository for temperature research at ASU to examine different temperature and solar radiation patterns across different regions. Based on traffic flow theory and fluid approximation queuing theory, this model highlights a simplified version of the world's atmosphere and the relationships between solar radiation and temperature.
