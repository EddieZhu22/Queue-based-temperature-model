## Description
This is a repository is for the Queue-based Temperature Model (QTM). Based on traffic flow theory and fluid approximation queuing theory, this model highlights a simplified version of the world's atmosphere and the relationships between solar radiation and total solar energy to draw several useful inferences about the system's performance, resilience, and adaptability.

### Model Overview
The model first takes in solar radiation & temperature data from a data source. Data for a case study done from 2022-2023 used 2019 NSRDB[1] data to attain a modelled 2-meter height and spatially homogeneous gridded dataset usable for the model. 

Then, the model is split into 2 steps:

**QTM STEP 1** - generates general sub-mesoscale system dynamics (Queue, inflow, outflow)

**QTM STEP 2** - turn these sub-mesoscale system dynamics into something meaningful (mesoscale indicators)

A table describing the equations & symbols used in this model are shown below:

Background Information: The Queue-based Temperature Model (QTM) is inspired by Newell‚Äôs fluid queueing model [2] and the Queue Volume Delay Function‚Äôs meso-macro framework [3], which offer the theoretical foundation for the model's underlying principles. The QTM consists of a two-step process. In the first step, sub-mesoscale system dynamics present within each day are obtained. In the second step, these dynamics are leveraged to make inferences on the mesoscale level. This allows for the analysis of the system at different levels of fidelity, providing valuable insights into the system's performance, resilience, and adaptability.
Model Framework: In the first step, intraday dynamics of extreme heat are approximated. When the temperature passes through an ‚Äúextreme heat‚Äù cutoff temperature, a queue of energy (Q(t)) starts forming. The queue has two critical components: an inflow and outflow denoted by Œª(t) and ¬µ(t) respectively. Œª(t) is given by the incoming solar radiation (Global Horizontal Irradiance). ¬µ(t) is the culmination of all factors that release energy out of the system. Because ¬µ(t) is not directly observable, a linear piecewise function is instead used to approximate the behavior. The net flow at a specific time (œÄ(t)) is given by subtracting Œª(t) from ¬µ(t). By integrating the net flow, a queue can be calculated. Boundary conditions of the model, t0 and t3, are at the start of the queue and the end of the queue respectively.
In the second step, using the dynamics present in each day and location, several inferences can be made regarding the system. Model outputs include P (heat exposure duration), C (capacity of the system), and D (total inflow demand). Each day these outputs are different, and give a more comprehensive picture of the system‚Äôs performance. These indicators can then directly be used in the mesoscale for further analysis.

### QTM STEP 1

#### EQUATIONS: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51139973/228726931-c1b58771-0ab1-4fae-a8c5-4ba51be840c5.png)

#### STEPS: 
INPUT: 10 minute surface solar radiation & 2-meter height air temperature of the
summer (93 days)
STEP 1.1: Determining the cutoff temperature. The cutoff temperature was set to be the top 2.5% of daily mean summertime temperatures, to prune out non extreme heat days. This resulted in a cutoff temperature of 38.02 ¬∞C. Then, the boundary conditions t0 and t3 were determined by finding the closest times to the cutoff temperature the Disruption and Recovery phases.
STEP 1.2: Finding t2 at max Q(t).  
STEP 1.3: Calculating ¬µ(t) using solar radiation data as input.
STEP 1.4: Computing the area between inflow Œª(t) and outflow ¬µ(t) to find the Queue.

### QTM STEP 2
INPUT: Queue, inflow, and outflow of the day (Q(t), Œª(t), and ¬µ(t)).
Based on the outputs from QTM Step 1, several system indicators were produced. The indicators and their formulas are listed below:
P: ùë°_3‚àíùë°_0- Heat Exposure Duration   
D: ‚à´2_ùë°0^ùë°3‚ñí„ÄñùúÜ(ùúè)„Äó ùëëùúè - Total Inflow Demand   
C: max(¬µ(t)) - Total System Capacity
Finally, since the outputs were created every day (93 days), the mean values of the indicators for the summer were calculated by averaging the daily results.
